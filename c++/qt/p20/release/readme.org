This program has only been tested on linux.

* To compile
The following commands should be run in the terminal, from the root directory of the project.

#+begin_src bash
qmake
make
#+end_src

* To run
from the root directory, execute the following.

The binary can be run from any directory, but will be missing a few assets if not run from the root directory, as the assets are located in directory `assets`.
