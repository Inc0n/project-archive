;; Because the items in this set are now ordered, they could be indexed at
;; the begining and the end of the set, so the number of steps is the same
;; as for the unordered representation. At the same time, searching for
;; items of many different sizes it would stop at a point near the beginning
;; and that other times search would reach near the end. On the average
;; the expected number of steps should be half of the items in the set.
;; Thus, the average number of steps required will be about n = 2. This is
;; still Î˜(n) growth, but it does save us, on the average, a factor of 2
;; in number of steps over the previous implementation.
