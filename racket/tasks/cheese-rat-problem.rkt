;; The Rat Eats The Cheese
;; May 14, 2019

;; A square maze contains cheese wedges on some of its squares:

;; Â· â€‰Â· â€‰Â·â€‰ðŸ§€ â€‰Â·
;; Â· â€‰Â· â€‰Â· â€‰Â· â€‰Â·
;; Â·â€‰ðŸ§€ â€‰Â·â€‰ðŸ§€â€‰ðŸ§€
;; Â· â€‰Â·â€‰ðŸ§€ â€‰Â·â€‰ðŸ§€
;; Â· â€‰Â· â€‰Â· â€‰Â· Â·

;; [ Did you know there is a cheese-wedge character in Unicode? I didnâ€™t. The center-dot is & # 183 ;, the cheese is & # 129472 ;, and I had to sprinkle in a few & thinsp ; characters to line things up. And of course to type those I had to add extra spaces, because WordPress is aggressive about turning them into characters. ]

;; A rat, starting at the lower left-hand corner of the maze, can move only up or right. What is the maximum amount of cheese the rat can eat?

;; Your task is to write a program to determine how much cheese the rat can eat. When you are finished, you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.

;;

;; because of the nature of list structure, my maze list is reversed up side down.
